Containers
The goal of this activity was to configure your jump box to run Docker containers and to install a container.



Start by installing docker.io on your Jump box.

Run sudo apt update then sudo apt install docker.io




Verify that the Docker service is running.


Run sudo systemctl status docker


Note: If the Docker service is not running, start it with sudo systemctl start docker.





Once Docker is installed, pull the container cyberxsecurity/ansible.


Run sudo docker pull cyberxsecurity/ansible.


You can also switch to the root user so you don't have to keep typing sudo.


Run sudo su.




Launch the Ansible container and connect to it using the appropriate Docker commands.


Run docker run -ti cyberxsecurity/ansible:latest bash to start the container.


Run exit to quit.
